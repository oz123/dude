DUDE is my am to make a FOSS Deskop Environment usable and easy.
It is a collection of ideas and scripts which I maintain on my few laptops
and Desktops.

These scripts correspond to my own personal taste of how things should work.
They are by no means the only way it should work. There is always a better
way. But KDE4 and GNOME 3 are not one of these ways. 

These ideas are meant for people who use computers as in their classical 
sense. Screen, keyboard and probably a chair for working on them. 

In the mean while DUDE is meant to work with Mate Desktop Environment, maybein the future I will make it work with some more geeky WM manager. 

DUDE also contains my own directory of dot files, because I'm too lazy to 
reconfigure my tmux, vim, vlc and other applications on each computer.
