This directory contains some configurations files to software that I use.

* dwm.config.h - configuration file to DWM[1], contains
  mainly two nice things:
  MOD Key is the Super_L key (the one with that Other OS symbol on it).
  Some nice keyboard shortcuts to switch keyboard layouts (currently between
  English, German and Hebrew - but you can change it ofcourse).
  Changing keys is done in multiple ways.
